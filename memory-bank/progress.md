# Project Progress for JMCP

## Current Status

The project is in the initial setup phase. The foundational documentation (Memory Bank) has been created, and the core architectural patterns have been defined. The basic project structure is in place, but the implementation of the core logic has not yet begun.

## What Works

-   The project can be built and compiled using Maven.
-   The basic Micronaut application context can be started.
-   The Memory Bank is initialized.

## What's Left to Build

1.  **Domain Logic:**
    *   Implement the `ClassDocumenter` service to handle the business logic of documenting a class.

2.  **Infrastructure Layer:**
    *   Implement the `VineFlowerClassDocumenter` adapter to integrate the Vineflower decompiler.
    *   Create REST endpoints or a CLI to expose the service to the outside world.

3.  **Testing:**
    *   Write unit tests for the domain services.
    *   Write integration tests for the infrastructure adapters and the application endpoints.

## Known Issues

-   None at this time.

## Project Evolution

-   **Initial Conception:** The project was conceived as a tool to help AI agents understand Java codebases.
-   **Architectural Decisions:** The choice of Micronaut, DDD, and Hexagonal Architecture was made to ensure a robust and maintainable system.
-   **Current Phase:** The project is moving from the planning and setup phase into the core implementation phase.
